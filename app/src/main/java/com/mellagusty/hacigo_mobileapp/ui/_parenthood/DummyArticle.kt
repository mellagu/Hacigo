                "by Kaitlin Lowe",
                "Let’s set the record straight: No child is too young to volunteer. In fact, during the toddler and preschool years, being a helper shapes a child’s developing sense of morality, says Joseph F. Hagan Jr., M.D., clinical professor of pediatrics at Larner College of Medicine at The University of Vermont, in Burlington.\n" +
                        "Pick wildflowers with your child, bundle them up, and together give the bouquet to a friend, a family member, or a neighbor who could use cheering up.\n" +
                        "Encourage him to notice a child playing alone and have him ask to join in.\n" +
                        "Pick out nonperishables from your cabinets together and pack a box for your local food bank. You could also consider starting a reverse Advent calendar, having your child put one item in a box every day leading up to Christmas. Dairy products and lean proteins are in high demand, so shelf-stable milk, peanut butter, and canned tuna are good to grab.\n" +
                        "Take advantage of your toddler’s love of sorting, and ask her to help put recyclables into your bin. It’s a good chance to remind yourself of the types of plastics and papers that can and can’t be recycled.\n" +
                        "Set up two coin jars in his room and give him change to collect. When they're full, help him choose one gift that you know a friend needs and one treat for being kind.\n" +
                        "Write “Thank you!” on cards for your preschooler to color. Carry them with you to give to workers or veterans you encounter.\n" +
                        "Decorate paper lunch bags and holiday-themed place mats together, then help add a special touch to deliveries by donating your crafts to Meals on Wheels or a local nursing home.",

                "So Your Child Needs a Feeding Tube—Here's Everything You Need to Know",
                "by Nancy Fitzgerald ",
                "Has your pediatrician suggested a feeding tube for your child? If you're experiencing a rush of emotions—from sadness to worry to full-blown panic—you're not alone. Nearly 200,000 American kids use feeding tubes for some, or all, of their nutritional needs.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "That means more than several other parents know exactly how you feel.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "\"Tube-feeding can be a traumatic thing to accept,\" explains Garey Noritz, M.D., a pediatrician and chief of the complex health care program at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \"Many parents may think they've done something wrong when their child has trouble eating or feeding—but that's not the case. A feeding tube is simply a tool we use to keep a child well-nourished. It's there for us to use as long as we need it.\n"+
                        "Is tube-feeding forever? Not necessarily. Kids with serious medical conditions may require feeding tubes for their whole lives, but for others, it's just temporary"+
                        "For some kids, the ability to eat gets better over time, he explains. Intensive feeding therapy can sometimes get them off their tubes and onto regular meals by mouth. And other children may even develop a hybrid eating pattern, having part of their meal by mouth and the rest through a tube.",

                "5 Ways to Make the Most of Weeknights With Your Kids",
                "by Lisa Lombardi",
                "One night when my older son was 12, he said in the cheeriest of tones, “Mom, I’ve spent more of my life with Mable than with you or Dad.” Mable is our nanny, you should know, and if you’re counting waking hours, he is technically right.\n" +
                        "\n" +
                        "File that under things that a working parent never, ever wants to hear. We already torture ourselves with that math. On weekdays, we might get just two hours with our kids each morning and two hours at night (depending on their ages), and it’s easy to feel teary and guilty if you compare those 20 hours with what the sitter or the day-care center gets. When Serena Williams was a new mom, she lamented on Twitter that she’d missed her baby’s first steps while she was training for Wimbledon. What parent couldn’t relate? Sure, there will be many milestones as our kids grow, but when you miss one, it rips your heart out.\n" +
